Inter-IC Sound (I2S)
====================

{IDF_TARGET_I2S_NUM:default="two", esp32s2="one", esp32c3="one"}

Overview
--------

I2S (Inter-IC Sound) is a serial, synchronous communication protocol that is usually used for transmitting audio data between two digital audio devices.

{IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains {IDF_TARGET_I2S_NUM} I2S peripheral(s). These peripherals can be configured to input and output sample data via the I2S driver.

An I2S bus consists of the following lines:

- Master clock line (operational)
- Bit clock line
- Channel select line
- Serial data line

Each I2S controller has the following features that can be configured using the I2S driver:

- Operation as system master or slave
- Capable of acting as transmitter or receiver
- DMA controller that allows for streaming sample data without requiring the CPU to copy each data sample

Each controller can operate in half-duplex communication mode. Thus, the two controllers can be combined to establish full-duplex communication.

.. only:: esp32

    I2S0 output can be routed directly to the digital-to-analog converter's (DAC) output channels (GPIO 25 & GPIO 26) to produce direct analog output without involving any external I2S codecs. I2S0 can also be used for transmitting PDM (Pulse-density modulation) signals.

.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2

    The I2S peripherals also support LCD mode for communicating data over a parallel bus, as used by some LCD displays and camera modules. LCD mode has the following operational modes:

    - LCD master transmitting mode
    - Camera slave receiving mode
    - ADC/DAC mode

    For more information, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *I2S Controller (I2S)* > LCD Mode [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#camlcdctrl>`__].

.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_APLL

    .. note::

        For high accuracy clock applications, use the APLL_CLK clock source, which has the frequency range of 16 ~ 128 MHz. You can enable the APLL_CLK clock source by setting :cpp:member:`i2s_config_t::use_apll` to ``TRUE``.

        If :cpp:member:`i2s_config_t::use_apll` = ``TRUE`` and :cpp:member:`i2s_config_t::fixed_mclk` > ``0``, then the master clock output frequency for I2S will be equal to the value of :cpp:member:`i2s_config_t::fixed_mclk`, which means that the mclk frequency is provided by the user, instead of being calculated by the driver.

        The clock rate of the word select line, which is called audio left-right clock rate (LRCK) here, is always the divisor of the master clock output frequency and for which the following is always true: 0 < MCLK/LRCK/channels/bits_per_sample < 64.


Functional Overview
-------------------


Installing the Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the I2S driver by calling the function :cpp:func:`i2s_driver_install` and passing the following arguments:

- Port number
- The initialized :cpp:type:`i2s_config_t` struct defining the communication parameters
- Event queue size and handle

An ``ESP_OK`` return value from :cpp:func:`i2s_driver_install` indictes I2S has started.

Configuration example:

.. only:: not SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_TDM

    .. code-block:: c

        static const int I2S_NUM = 0; // i2s port number

        i2s_config_t i2s_config = {
            .mode = I2S_MODE_MASTER | I2S_MODE_TX,
            .sample_rate = 44100,
            .bits_per_sample = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT,
            .channel_format = I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_RIGHT_LEFT,
            .communication_format = I2S_COMM_FORMAT_STAND_I2S
            .tx_desc_auto_clear = false,
            .dma_desc_num = 8,
            .dma_frame_num = 64,
            .use_apll = false,
            .intr_alloc_flags = ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL1  // Interrupt level 1, default 0
        };

        i2s_driver_install(I2S_NUM, &i2s_config, 0, NULL);

.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_TDM

    .. code-block:: c

        static const int I2S_NUM = 0; // i2s port number

        i2s_config_t i2s_config = {
            .mode = I2S_MODE_MASTER | I2S_MODE_TX,
            .sample_rate = 44100,
            .bits_per_sample = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT,
            .channel_format = I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_RIGHT_LEFT,
            .communication_format = I2S_COMM_FORMAT_STAND_I2S,
            .tx_desc_auto_clear = false,
            .dma_desc_num = 8,
            .dma_frame_num = 64,
            .bits_per_chan = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT
        };

        i2s_driver_install(I2S_NUM, &i2s_config, 0, NULL);

Setting Communication Pins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the driver is installed, configure the physical GPIO pins to which signals will be routed. This is accomplished by calling the function :cpp:func:`i2s_set_pin` with the following arguments to it:

- Port number
- The structure :cpp:type:`i2s_pin_config_t` which defines the GPIO pin numbers for the MCK, BCK, WS, DATA out, and DATA in signals. To keep a currently allocated pin number for a specific signal, or if this signal is unused,  pass the macro :c:macro:`I2S_PIN_NO_CHANGE`. See the example below.

.. note::

    MCK only takes effect in `I2S_MODE_MASTER` mode.

.. code-block:: c

    static const i2s_pin_config_t pin_config = {
        .mck_io_num = 0,
        .bck_io_num = 4,
        .ws_io_num = 5,
        .data_out_num = 18,
        .data_in_num = I2S_PIN_NO_CHANGE
    };

    i2s_set_pin(I2S_NUM, &pin_config);

Running I2S Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To perform a transmission:

- Prepare the data for sending
- Call the function :cpp:func:`i2s_write` and pass the data buffer address and data length to it

The function will write the data to the DMA Tx buffer, and the data will be transmitted automatically.

.. code-block:: c

    i2s_write(I2S_NUM, samples_data, ((bits+8)/16)*SAMPLE_PER_CYCLE*4, &i2s_bytes_write, 100);

To retrieve received data, use the function :cpp:func:`i2s_read`. It will retrieve the data from the DMA Rx buffer once the data is received by the I2S controller.

.. code-block:: c

    i2s_read(I2S_NUM, data_recv, ((bits+8)/16)*SAMPLE_PER_CYCLE*4, &i2s_bytes_read, 100);

You can temporarily halt the I2S driver by calling the function :cpp:func:`i2s_stop`, which disables the I2S Tx/Rx units until the  :cpp:func:`i2s_start` is called. If the function :cpp:func:`i2s_driver_install` is used, the driver will start up automatically eliminating the need to call :cpp:func:`i2s_start`.


Deleting the Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If I2S communication is no longer required, the driver can be removed to free allocated resources by calling :cpp:func:`i2s_driver_uninstall`.


Application Example

    I2S on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} support TDM mode, up to 16 channels are available in TDM mode. If you want to use TDM mode, set field ``channel_format`` of :cpp:type:`i2s_config_t` to ``I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_MULTIPLE``. Then enable the channels by setting ``chan_mask`` using masks in :cpp:type:`i2s_channel_t`, the number of active channels and total channels will be calculate automatically. You can also set a particular total channel number for it, but it shouldn't be smaller than the largest channel you use.

    If active channels are discrete, the inactive channels within total channels will be filled by a constant automatically. But if ``skip_msk`` is enabled, these inactive channels will be skiped.

Application Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using a  sample rate of more than 48 kHz or are suffering data loss, the following information might be helpful.

In order to accomodate different application requirements, some aspects of DMA are made public via the ``dma_desc_num`` and ``dma_frame_num`` parameters. The following section provides a detailed description of these two fields:

- ``dma_desc_num``: The total number of descriptors used by I2S DMA to receive/transmit data. A descriptor includes information such as buffer address, the address of the next descriptor, and the buffer length. As each descriptor points to one buffer,  ``dma_desc_num`` can be interpreted as the total number of DMA buffers used to store data in the DMA interrupt. Note that these buffers are internal to :cpp:func:`i2s_read` and descriptors are created automatically inside the I2S driver. Users only need to configure the number of buffers while their size is derived from the parameter described below.
- ``dma_frame_num``: The number of frames for one-time sampling. In this context, "frame" refers to the data from all channels in one WS cycle. For example, if two channels in stereo mode (i.e., ``channel_format`` is set to ``I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_RIGHT_LEFT``) are active, and each channel transfers 32 bits (i.e., ``bits_per_sample`` is set to ``I2S_BITS_PER_CHAN_32BIT``), then the total number of bytes in a frame is ``channel_format`` * ``bits_per_sample`` = 2 * 32 / 8 = 8 bytes. Assuming the current value of ``dma_frame_num`` is 100,  the length of the DMA buffer is 8 * 100 = 800 bytes. Note that the length of an internal DMA buffer shouldn't be greater than 4092.

When the data received by DMA reaches the size of internal DMA buffer, a receive interrupt is triggered, and an internal message queue will transport this buffer to :cpp:func:`i2s_read`. The main task of :cpp:func:`i2s_read` is to copy the data from the internal DMA buffer into the buffer provided by the user. Since the internal DMA buffer is usually not equal to the size of the user buffer, there are two cases:

- If the size of internal DMA buffers is smaller than the user buffer, :cpp:func:`i2s_read` will consume several internal DMA buffers to fill up the user provided buffer. If the message queue of the DMA buffer is not long enough, :cpp:func:`i2s_read` will  block on the receive message queue until it receives enough data. Estimate the time :cpp:func:`i2s_read` blocks by the formula block_time (sec) = (user_buffer_size) / (sample_rate * channel_num * channel_bytes). If we place :cpp:func:`i2s_read` in a ``while``-loop  with other functions we also need to consider the time the loop execution is blocked by the other functions before :cpp:func:`i2s_read` is executed again. Do not exceed max_wait_time (sec) = ((``dma_desc_num`` - 1) * dma_buffer_size) / (sample_rate), otherwise the internal message queue will overflow and in consequence some data will be lost.
- If the DMA buffer size is greater than the user buffer, :cpp:func:`i2s_read`  needs to be called repeatedly in order to consume all available data. ``max_wait_time`` may be exceeded, and the message queue is likely to overflow. This makes it quite risky to use a small user buffer for receiving data.

Here are a some tips to optimize data throughput:

1. Increasing ``dma_frame_num`` may help to reduce the I2S DMA interrupt frequency;
2. Increasing ``dma_desc_num`` may help prolong max_wait_time leaving more time for other functions in the :cpp:func:`i2s_read` loop:

    .. code-block:: c

        while (1) {
            ... // Other operations (e.g. Waiting on a semaphore)
            i2s_read(I2S_NUM, user_given_buffer, user_given_buffer_size, &i2s_bytes_read, 100);
            ... // Other operations (e.g. Sending the data to another thread. Avoid any data processing here.)
        }

3. Increasing the size of :cpp:func:`i2s_read`'s internal buffer may help increase max_wait_time. When processing I2S data (like storing the data to an SD card) in another thread, the time spent in the processing thread for one loop should not exceed  max_wait_time, otherwise data will be lost. The longer the processing of the samples take, the larger :cpp:func:`i2s_read`'s internal buffers need to be.
4. Allocating at least two user buffers can improve the efficiency of reads. One buffer can continue to receive data while the other one is being processed. This requires us to ensure the buffer reading data is not being processed in another thread. We can use a semaphore or another lock to avoid overwriting the data during processing;

    .. code-block:: c

        uint8_t **user_given_buffers = (uint8_t **)calloc(buffer_num, sizeof(uint8_t *));
        // Don't forget to check if user_given_buffers is NULL here
        for (int i = 0; i < buffer_num; i++) {
            user_given_buffers[i] = (uint8_t *)calloc(user_given_buffer_size, sizeof(uint8_t));
            // Don't forget to check if user_given_buffers[i] is NULL here
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        while (1) {
            ... // Other operations (e.g. Waiting on a semaphore)
            i2s_read(I2S_NUM, user_given_buffer[cnt], user_given_buffer_size, &i2s_bytes_read, 100);
            ... // Other operations (e.g. Sending the data to another thread. Avoid any data processing here.)
            cnt++;
            cnt %= buffer_num;
        }

5. Increasing the priority of the thread calling :cpp:func:`i2s_read` may help the data in the message queue to be copied more quickly.

To check whether data is lost, you can provide an event queue handler to the driver during installation:

    .. code-block:: c

        QueueHandle_t evt_que;
        i2s_driver_install(i2s_num, &i2s_config, 10, &evt_que);

Data loss will trigger an ``I2S_EVENT_RX_Q_OVF`` event.
